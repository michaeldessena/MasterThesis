%\label{chap:MultiplePartonInteractions}


%By the fact that the hadrons are viewed as "bunches" of partons, it is likely that in the same hadron-hadron collision different couples of partons can undergo to a scattering. This phenomenon is known as \textit{Multiple Parton Interactions} (MPI) and it is related to the composite nature of the incoming hadrons. 
%\\
%So, it is clear that at some level these MPI have to exist, and they can become important in the description of the event; they can change the color topology of the colliding system as a whole.  
%\\
%In this scenario it is important to have a good understanding of the phenomenon. The aim of this section is to describe the basic concepts that are use to simulate MPI, for example in \textsc{Pythia} Monte Carlo event generator; then some focus is given to the free parameters we are going to tune in the following sections.
%
%\section{Basic Concepts}
%\label{sec:BasicConcepts}
%
%The main hypothesis of the multiple interactions models is that: the QCD factorization theorem is true not only for the hard process but also for the other partons scatters.
%\\
%So, we can write:
%\begin{equation}
%	\frac{d\sigma_{\text{int}}}{dp_\perp}=\displaystyle\sum_{i,j,k,l}\displaystyle\int dx_1 \displaystyle\int dx_2 \displaystyle\int d\hat{t}\, f_i(x_1,Q^2)f_j(x_2,Q^2)\frac{d\hat{\sigma}_{ij\,\rightarrow\,kl}}{d\hat{t}}\delta\left( p_\perp^2-\frac{\hat{t}\hat{u}}{\hat{s}} \right) \quad .
%	\label{eq:sigma_int1}
%\end{equation}
%This represent the interaction differential cross section for the hadron-hadron collisions, where $\frac{d\hat{\sigma}_{ij\,\rightarrow\,kl}}{d\hat{t}}$ is the differential cross section for QCD hard $2\ \rightarrow 2$ processes, this processes are the one reported in \tableRef{table:partonic_cross_sections}. 
%\\
%In \eqRef{eq:sigma_int1} we used the Mandelstam variables associated to the partonic system:
%\begin{align}
%	&\hat{s}=(p_1+p_2)^2=(p_3+p_4)^2=x_1x_2s\\
%	&\hat{t}=(p_1-p_3)^2=(p_2-p_4)^2\\
%	&\hat{u}=(p_1-p_4)^2=(p_2-p_3)^2
%\end{align} 
%where $p_1$, $p_2$ are the four-momenta of the incoming partons and $p_3$, $p_4$ the four-momenta of the outgoing partons. 
%
%%Note that in \eqRef{eq:sigma_int1} the jet cross section is twice as large $\sigma_{\text{jet}}=2\sigma_{\text{int}}$, because at first approximation each interaction gives rise to two jets.
%
%\noindent We assume also that the "hardness" of processes is defined by the $p_T$ scale of the interaction ($Q^2=p_T^2$).

%
%\noindent As you can see from the formulae in \tableRef{table:partonic_cross_sections}
%at small scattering angles, for $t\,\rightarrow\,0$,  the t-channel gluon exchange processes $qq'\,\rightarrow\,qq'$, $qg\,\rightarrow\,qg$ and $gg\,\rightarrow\,gg$ dominate the full matrix element. For scatterings that are soft relative to $\hat{s}$, $|\hat{t}|\ll \hat{s}$, we can approximate $|\hat{t}|$ as:
%\begin{equation}
%	p_T^2=\frac{\hat{t}\hat{u}}{\hat{s}} = \frac{\hat{t}(-\hat{s}-\hat{t})}{\hat{s}} \approx |\hat{t}|\quad ,
%\end{equation}
%in this limit, the only differences between quark and gluon cross sections are the color factors
%\begin{equation}
%	\hat{\sigma}_{gg}:\hat{\sigma}_{qg}:\hat{\sigma}_{qq}=\frac{9}{4}:1:\frac{4}{9}\quad .
%\end{equation}
%So, the \eqRef{eq:sigma_int1} can be rewritten like
%\begin{equation}
%	\frac{d\sigma_{int}}{dp_T^2}\approx\int\int\frac{dx_1}{x_1}\,\frac{dx_2}{x_2}\,F(x_1,p_T^2)\,F(x_2,p_T^2)\frac{d\hat{\sigma}_{2\,\rightarrow\,2}}{dp_T^2}\quad ,
%	\label{eq:sigma_int2}
%\end{equation}
%whit:
%	\begin{gather}
%		\frac{d\hat{\sigma}_{2\,\rightarrow\,2}}{dp_T^2} = \frac{8\pi\alpha_s^2(p_T^2)}{9p_T^4}\quad ;\\
%		F(x,Q^2)=\displaystyle\sum_q\left( x\,q(x,Q^2) + x\,\overline{q}(x,Q^2) \right) + \frac{9}{4}\,x\,g(x,Q^2)\quad .
%	\end{gather}
%Now, we can integrate the \eqRef{eq:sigma_int2}:
%\begin{equation}
%	\sigma_{int}(p_{T\,min})= \displaystyle\int_{ p_{T\,min}^2}^{(\sqrt{s}/2)^2}\frac{d\hat{\sigma}_{2\,\rightarrow\,2}}{dp_T^2}\,dp_T^2\propto \frac{1}{p_{T\,min}^2}\  \xrightarrow{\ \ p_{T\,min}\,\rightarrow\, 0 \ }\ \ \infty
%	\label{eq:interaction_crossSection}
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{figure}[!ht]
%	\centering
%	\includegraphics[width=12cm]{{img/CrossSection_Tot.png}}
%	\caption{This figure shows the interaction cross section ($\sigma_{\text{int}}$) at Tevatron ($p\overline{p}$, $\sqrt{s}=1.8\ \mathrm{TeV}$) and at LHC ($pp$, $\sqrt{s}=14\ \mathrm{TeV}$). The flat lines are the corresponding values for the total cross section. The interaction cross section that arise from \eqRef{eq:interaction_crossSection} is divergent for $p_{T\,min}\,\rightarrow\,0$ in reality a dumping of this divergence is expected due to the color screening effect.}
%	\label{fig:CrossSection_Tot}
%\end{figure}
%
%\noindent The total cross section is divergent in the limit $p_T\,\rightarrow\,0$, this divergence is shown in \figRef{fig:CrossSection_Tot}. Due to this divergence the total interaction cross section at some $p_{T}$ scale can exceed the total proton-proton cross section.
%\\
%To understand this paradox should be noted that the interaction cross section described in \eqRef{eq:interaction_crossSection} is related to the interaction probability between two partons and counts the number of interactions, while the total proton-proton cross section $\sigma_{pp}$ counts the number of events. For example, an event (a proton-proton collision) in which two partons interact counts once in the total cross section and twice in the interaction cross section.
%\\
%So, the ratio between this two quantities is perfectly allowed to be larger than unity, we can write it down as:
%\begin{equation}
%	\frac{\sigma_{int}(p_{T\,min})}{\sigma_{tot}}=\langle n \rangle (p_{T\,min})\quad .
%\end{equation}
%Furthermore, we have to consider the \textit{screening effect}: in fact the incoming hadrons are color singlet objects. Therefore, when the $p_T$ of an exchanged gluon is small, and so the associated wavelength large, this gluon cannot longer resolve the color charges and the effective coupling is decreased, this screening set a cutoff in the divergence. The screening effect is schematically shown in \figRef{fig:ScreeningEffect}.
%
%\begin{figure}[!ht]
%	\centering
%	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{{img/ScreeningEffect.png}}
%	\caption{A picture of the screening effect. The left figure show two color charge that are not resolved by the gluon in fact the wave length is greater than the spatial separation, $d$, of the two charges. So resolution of the probe is not enough to discriminate the color charges. While on the right figure the two charges are very well distinct.}
%	\label{fig:ScreeningEffect}
%\end{figure}
%
%\noindent So, this cutoff is associated with color screening distance i.e. the average size of the region within the  compensation of color charge occurs.
%This cutoff is then introduced in the factor as:
%\begin{equation}
%	\frac{\alpha_s^2\,(p_{T0}^2+p_{T}^2)}{\alpha_s^2\,(p_T^2)}\,\frac{p_T^4}{(p_{T0}^2+p_T^2)^2}\quad .
%\end{equation}
%This factor contains the phenomenological regularization of the divergence, with the factor $p_{T0}$ that have to be tuned to data. 
%\\
%Now the interaction cross section is smoothly regularized and therefore finite.
%\\
%To be notice that: parameter $p_{T0}$ do not have to be energy-independent, but since the energy is related with the sensibility of our probe, higher energy is related with the capacity of probing PDFs to lower x values (as discussed previously, see \figRef{fig:NNPDF31}) and in this low x region the number of partons rapidly increases. So, the partons are closer packed in this regions and as a consequence the color screening distance decrease.
%\\
%The number of partons is related to $x$ with a power low so, it is likely to have a dependence of the same form for $p_{T0}$ respect to the center-of-mass energy
%\begin{equation}
%	p_{T0}(\sqrt{s})=p_{T0}^{ref} \,\left( \frac{\sqrt{s}}{E_{CM}^{ref}} \right)^{E_{CM}^{pow}}\quad .
%\end{equation}
%In the next section we are going to discuss how this and other effects fit into the Monte Carlo generator \textsc{pythia8}.

\section{All-order approaches and PYTHIA Monte Carlo generator}

A different approach to describe the phenomena observed at high-energy colliders, instead of calculating cross sections order by order in the perturbative expansion, is the use of an \textit{all-order} approach. 
\\
%Different all-order approaches exist such as resummation techniques and parton showers. Resummation is based on the observation that in many quantities the smallness of the expansion coefficients $\alpha_s$ is violated by large logarithmic enhancements. This takes the dominant contribution from each order and "resums" them by means of an evolution equation. 
%\\
%The main problem in QCD is related to the fact that lots of quantities have logarithmic corrections that can lead to divergences. Resummation avoids these divergences.
%%The main problem in QCD is related to the fact that lot of quantities have corrections of the form $\alpha_s^n\log^k(Q_i/Q_j)$ where $Q_i$ and $Q_j$ are two different energies scales, for example:
%%\begin{itemize}
%%	\item[--] Renormalization $\mu_R=Q^2$ and factorization scales logs: $\alpha_s^n\log^n(Q^2/\mu_f)$
%%\end{itemize}
%Various methods to perform this resummation exist depending on the process and the type of divergence that has to be eliminated.
%\\
%%%%% GRAPH on pT Z with effect of resummation 
%An example is the $Z$ production $p_T$ spectrum shown in \figRef{figure:pT_Z_CDF}: here the comparison between experimental CDF data and theoretical predictions is shown: in the low $p_T$ region the \textit{all-order} approach regularizes the divergence of the fixed order calculation and describes the data better. 
%

%	\label{figure:pT_Z_CDF}
%\end{figure}
%
%An other \textit{all-order} approach is based on the simulation of the so-called \textit{parton shower}. It is  implemented in different Monte Carlo programs, as  \textsc{pythia} \cite{PYTHIA2015}, \textsc{herwig} \cite{Herwig2008} and \textsc{sherpa} \cite{SHERPA2004}.
%
%The following sections will focus on parton shower in particular on its implementation in
%\textsc{Pythia}8. \textsc{Pythia} is a standard tool for the simulation of events in high energy collisions. \textsc{Pythia} contains the evolution from a few-body system to a complex multiparticles final state. It simulate a lot of different processes, some of them are described below. Let starts with a discussion on how the parton shower work and how it is implemented in \textsc{pythia}.

The most violent proton-proton collision at the LHC can have an high number of separated jets, $\sim 5\div 10$. If these jets are observed from a nearest point of view what one can observe is a fractal composition of jets-inside-jets-inside-jets. This structure is expected to continue down to the hadronization scale, a bit below $1\ \mathrm{GeV}$. This fractal nature can lead to hundred of partons in the final-state that then are masked inside the hadrons.
The main problem in the theory is that there is no way to perform matrix element calculation to describe such complicated event topology. Instead, the standard procedure is to use an \textit{all-order} approach: \textit{parton showers}.  




\subsection{Parton Showers}
 
%The idea is to start from the matrix element calculation of the hard interactions and then apply the parton shower to the partons participating in it. The parton shower dress up the partons by emissions at successively "softer" and "more collinear" resolution scales. This shower is build in a recursive manner from the larger scale defined by the hard process toward the cutoff at the hadronization scale.   
 
The parton shower algorithm starts from few partons arising from a hard interaction evaluated by means of the matrix element calculation. Then, as the energy scale at which we examines the scattering decrease these harder partons can split by emission of gluons or quark anti-quark pairs, and so more partons are produced in the shower that can split in their turn. In this process the higher scale partons are related to the lower hadronization energy scale (close to $1 \ \mathrm{GeV}$) using the DGLAP evolution equation formalism. The solution to this equation can be written using a \textit{Sudakov form factor} arising from the probability of no gluon emission in the evolution from higher to lower scale and ensure the unity for the branching total probability.
\\
In the parton showering process, in addition to the kinematic variables (momentum fraction $z$ and azimuthal angle $\phi$) and flavours of the partons, an evolution variable $t$ is generated. \textsc{Pythia8} uses as  evolution variable the squared of the relative transverse momentum of the two partons in the splitting ($p_T^2$). Different choices are made in \textsc{herwig} and \textsc{sherpa}.
\\
As mentioned before, the shower evolution is based on the standard (LO) DGLAP splitting kernels P(z) described here:
\begin{align}
P_{q\,\rightarrow\,qg}(z) & = C_F\frac{1+z^2}{1-z}\quad ; \label{eq:DGLAP_splitting1}\\
P_{g\,\rightarrow\,gg}(z) & = C_A\frac{(1-z(1-z))^2}{z(1-z)}\quad ; \label{eq:DGLAP_splitting2}\\
P_{q\,\rightarrow\,q\overline{q}}(z) & = T_R(z^2+(1-z)^2)\quad ; \label{eq:DGLAP_splitting3}
\end{align} 
where $C_F=\frac{4}{3}$ is the Casimir operator for $SU(3)$, $C_A=N_C=3$, that are named "color factors", and $T_R=\frac{1}{2}$ that is given by the trace calculation of the group generators, each contribution is multiplied by $N_f$ if summing over all contributing quark flavours.
\\
The parton shower consist of two components: the initial-state radiation (ISR) describing the emission from the incoming partons and the final-state radiation (FSR) describing emission of outgoing partons they are also respectively referred as spacelike and timelike showers.
Both ISR and FSR algorithms are based on these splitting kernels introduced in \eqRef{eq:DGLAP_splitting1}, \ref{eq:DGLAP_splitting2} and \ref{eq:DGLAP_splitting3}.
The respective probabilities of emitting radiation as one moves in the decreasing evolution variable sequence are:
\begin{align}
	FSR: \qquad\quad & \frac{d\mathcal{P}_{FSR}}{dp_T^2} = \frac{1}{p_T^2}\displaystyle\int \frac{dz}{z}\,\frac{\alpha_s}{2\pi}P(z)\quad ;\label{eq:FSR1}\\
	ISR: \qquad\quad & \frac{d\mathcal{P}_{ISR}}{dp_T^2} = \frac{1}{p_T^2}\displaystyle\int \frac{dz}{z}\,\frac{\alpha_s}{2\pi}P(z)\,\frac{f'(x/z,p_T^2)}{f(x,p_T^2)}\quad .\label{eq:ISR1}
\end{align}
Where the FSR one represent the infinitesimal probability that a parton branches, or in this case decays, in a $dp_T^2$ step.
Instead, \eqRef{eq:ISR1} refers to the same probability but it include the description of the PDF evolution in fact the ISR is described in terms of production of a parton (instead of decays probability as in FSR). The slitting kernel are the same described above except that the production of a gluon $P_g(z)$ is equal to $2P_{gg}(z)$ since two gluons are generated from the decay of one gluon.

Staring from these infinitesimal probability by multiplication of no emission probability $1-dP_{ISR}$, or equally $1-dP_{ISR}$. 
The Sudakov form factor can written-out, as: % by means of the two probability in \eqRef{eq:FSR1} and \eqRef{eq:ISR1}, as
\begin{equation}
	\Delta(p_T^2)=\exp\left( -\displaystyle\int_{p_{T0}^{PS}}^{p_T'} \frac{d\mathcal{P}_{PS}}{dp_T^2} \,dp_T\right) \qquad\text{ with } \quad PS=ISR,\ FSR \quad.
	\label{eq:sudakovFormFactor}
\end{equation}
The Sudakov form factor give the probability of a parton to evolve from an harder scale to a softer scale without emitting a parton harder than some resolution scale.
\\
The introduction of the Sudakov form factor resums all the effects from the soft and collinear gluon emission. For more details and some plots of different Sudakov form factor values see section 3.5 of \cite{Campbell2006}.


 In \textsc{pythia}8 the contributions from ISR, FSR are interleaved into a single common sequence of decreasing $p_T$. 
\\
It as been seen that the solution to the DGLAP equation is given putting \eqRef{eq:FSR1} and \eqRef{eq:ISR1} in \eqRef{eq:sudakovFormFactor} respectively for the ISR and the FSR by a Sudakov form factor that is related to the no emission probability in the $p_T$-evolution. 
\\
The evolution variables for ISR and FSR are defined starting from the virtuality ($Q^2$) of the emission:
\begin{equation}
	p_T^2=\left\{\begin{aligned}
		&(1-z)Q^2 && ISR\\
		&z(1-z)Q^2 && FSR
	\end{aligned}\right.\quad,
	\label{eq:partonShowerEvolutionVariables}
\end{equation}
so, in the two cases: for the FSR $Q^2_{FSR}=(p^2-m_0^2)$ in fact a time-like virtuality ($p^2>0$) is implicated, while for the ISR we have $Q^2_{ISR}=(-p^2+m_0^2)$ with a space-like virtuality ($p^2<0$). In both case $Q^2$ values are positive defined. Than the actual strong of the radiation is set by the choices of $\alpha_{s\,ISR}$ and $\alpha_{s\,FSR}$ values.

The threshold on the transverse momentum scale for ISR, $p_{T0}^{ISR}$, and FSR, $p_{T0}^{FSR}$,  are free parameters in \textsc{pyhtia} and are called \texttt{Space}\-\texttt{Shower:}\-\texttt{pT0}\-\texttt{Ref}   and \texttt{Time}\-\texttt{Shower:}\-\texttt{pT0}\-\texttt{min}.


The parton showers alone are certainly not the whole story in describing the exclusive structure of an event. They are based on collinear and soft approximation. A good description of the hard wide-angle emission and multi jet final state cannot be ignored in order to describe many of the observables of interest. So, it is important to perform an higher order matrix element calculations to describes better all these observables.  


\subsection{Merging parton showers and NLO matrix element calculations}
\label{sec:merging}

Regions dominated by soft and collinear gluon emissions are described very well by parton showers approach; on the other hand, regions where partons are  energetic and widely separated are well described by matrix element calculations and not by parton showers.  
So, the best approach would be to combine the two different descriptions, and this is what is performed in the Monte Carlo generators. But to combine NLO matrix element calculation with parton showers the naive procedure of simply adding a parton shower to an event generated with a matrix element generator does not work.
\\
One problem arise by the fact that tree-level matrix elements are \textit{inclusive}, i.e. they give the probability of having at least $n$ partons in a state calculated exactly to lowest order in $\alpha_s$, while the corresponding state generated by a parton shower is \textit{exclusive}, i.e. gives the probability that there are exactly $n$ partons calculated approximately to all orders in $\alpha_s$
\\
The second problem is that to avoid the \textit{double counting} of some regions of phase space or, conversely, the undercount other regions.

To solve these problems there are different strategies. The various strategies are divided in two group. The ones refered as \textit{"match"} are those approaches in which high-order corrections to an inclusive process are integrated with the parton shower. The other strategy involves a \textit{"merge"} this is done by defining a merging scale, where any parton produced above that scale is generated with a corresponding higher-order matrix element and any parton produced below is generated by the shower.


An example of merging approach is the FxFx merging scheme, developed by Frixione, Nason, Webber in the \textsc{mc@nlo} framework \cite{FxFx1,FxFx2,FxFx3,FxFx4}. In this scenario the risk of  double counting is given by the fact that at NLO one emission can be made explicit as indicated in \figRef{fig:DoubleCounting} by the red gluon line, then the progress of the parton shower can leads to a double counting between real emission matrix element and the parton shower as shown in \figRef{fig:DoubleCounting}, the double counting sources are indicated by the blue arrows.

So, it is clear that the matrix element calculations cannot be blindly combined with parton showers. The combination of these two approaches is a very active research topic, and is important for giving
a good description for jet production from QCD.

\section{Multiple Parton Interactions in PYTHIA}


By the fact that the hadrons are viewed as "bunches" of partons, it is likely that in the same hadron-hadron collision different couples of partons can undergo to a scattering. This phenomenon is known as \textit{Multiple Parton Interactions} and it is related to the composite nature of the incoming hadrons. 
\\
So, it is clear that at some level these MPI have to exist, and they can become important in the description of the event; they can change the color topology of the colliding system as a whole.  
\\
In this scenario it is important to have a good understanding of the phenomenon. The aim of this section is to describe the basic concepts that are use to simulate MPI, for example in \textsc{Pythia} Monte Carlo event generator; then some focus is given to the free parameters we are going to tune in the following sections.

\subsection{Basic Concepts}
\label{sec:BasicConcepts}

The main hypothesis of the multiple interactions models is that: the QCD factorization theorem is true not only for the hard process but also for the other partons scatters.
\\
So, we can write:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\sigma_{\text{int}}}{dp_\perp}=\displaystyle\sum_{i,j,k,l}\displaystyle\int dx_1 \displaystyle\int dx_2 \displaystyle\int d\hat{t}\, f_i(x_1,Q^2)f_j(x_2,Q^2)\frac{d\hat{\sigma}_{ij\,\rightarrow\,kl}}{d\hat{t}}\delta\left( p_\perp^2-\frac{\hat{t}\hat{u}}{\hat{s}} \right) \quad .
	\label{eq:sigma_int1}
\end{equation}
This represent the interaction differential cross section for the hadron-hadron collisions, where $\frac{d\hat{\sigma}_{ij\,\rightarrow\,kl}}{d\hat{t}}$ is the differential cross section for QCD hard $2\ \rightarrow 2$ processes, this processes are the one reported in \tableRef{table:partonic_cross_sections}. 
\\
In \eqRef{eq:sigma_int1} we used the Mandelstam variables associated to the partonic system:
\begin{align}
	&\hat{s}=(p_1+p_2)^2=(p_3+p_4)^2=x_1x_2s\\
	&\hat{t}=(p_1-p_3)^2=(p_2-p_4)^2\\
	&\hat{u}=(p_1-p_4)^2=(p_2-p_3)^2
\end{align} 
where $p_1$, $p_2$ are the four-momenta of the incoming partons and $p_3$, $p_4$ the four-momenta of the outgoing partons. 

%Note that in \eqRef{eq:sigma_int1} the jet cross section is twice as large $\sigma_{\text{jet}}=2\sigma_{\text{int}}$, because at first approximation each interaction gives rise to two jets.

\noindent We assume also that the "hardness" of processes is defined by the $p_T$ scale of the interaction ($Q^2=p_T^2$).

%	\label{table:partonic_cross_sections}
%\end{table}

\noindent As you can see from the formulae in \tableRef{table:partonic_cross_sections}
at small scattering angles, for $t\,\rightarrow\,0$,  the t-channel gluon exchange processes $qq'\,\rightarrow\,qq'$, $qg\,\rightarrow\,qg$ and $gg\,\rightarrow\,gg$ dominate the full matrix element. For scatterings that are soft relative to $\hat{s}$, $|\hat{t}|\ll \hat{s}$, we can approximate $|\hat{t}|$ as:
\begin{equation}
	p_T^2=\frac{\hat{t}\hat{u}}{\hat{s}} = \frac{\hat{t}(-\hat{s}-\hat{t})}{\hat{s}} \approx |\hat{t}|\quad ,
\end{equation}
in this limit, the only differences between quark and gluon cross sections are the color factors
\begin{equation}
	\hat{\sigma}_{gg}:\hat{\sigma}_{qg}:\hat{\sigma}_{qq}=\frac{9}{4}:1:\frac{4}{9}\quad .
\end{equation}
So, the \eqRef{eq:sigma_int1} can be rewritten like
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\sigma_{int}}{dp_T^2}\approx\int\int\frac{dx_1}{x_1}\,\frac{dx_2}{x_2}\,F(x_1,p_T^2)\,F(x_2,p_T^2)\frac{d\hat{\sigma}_{2\,\rightarrow\,2}}{dp_T^2}\quad ,
	\label{eq:sigma_int2}
\end{equation}
whit:
	\begin{gather}
		\frac{d\hat{\sigma}_{2\,\rightarrow\,2}}{dp_T^2} = \frac{8\pi\alpha_s^2(p_T^2)}{9p_T^4}\quad ;\\
		F(x,Q^2)=\displaystyle\sum_q\left( x\,q(x,Q^2) + x\,\overline{q}(x,Q^2) \right) + \frac{9}{4}\,x\,g(x,Q^2)\quad .
	\end{gather}
Now, we can integrate the \eqRef{eq:sigma_int2}:
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{int}(p_{T\,min})= \displaystyle\int_{ p_{T\,min}^2}^{(\sqrt{s}/2)^2}\frac{d\hat{\sigma}_{2\,\rightarrow\,2}}{dp_T^2}\,dp_T^2\propto \frac{1}{p_{T\,min}^2}\  \xrightarrow{\ \ p_{T\,min}\,\rightarrow\, 0 \ }\ \ \infty
	\label{eq:interaction_crossSection}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=12cm]{{img/CrossSection_Tot.png}}
	\caption{This figure shows the interaction cross section ($\sigma_{\text{int}}$) at Tevatron ($p\overline{p}$, $\sqrt{s}=1.8\ \mathrm{TeV}$) and at LHC ($pp$, $\sqrt{s}=14\ \mathrm{TeV}$). The flat lines are the corresponding values for the total cross section. The interaction cross section that arise from \eqRef{eq:interaction_crossSection} is divergent for $p_{T\,min}\,\rightarrow\,0$ in reality a dumping of this divergence is expected due to the color screening effect.}
	\label{fig:CrossSection_Tot}
\end{figure}

\noindent The total cross section is divergent in the limit $p_T\,\rightarrow\,0$, this divergence is shown in \figRef{fig:CrossSection_Tot}. Due to this divergence the total interaction cross section at some $p_{T}$ scale can exceed the total proton-proton cross section.
\\
To understand this paradox should be noted that the interaction cross section described in \eqRef{eq:interaction_crossSection} is related to the interaction probability between two partons and counts the number of interactions, while the total proton-proton cross section $\sigma_{pp}$ counts the number of events. For example, an event (a proton-proton collision) in which two partons interact counts once in the total cross section and twice in the interaction cross section.
\\
So, the ratio between this two quantities is perfectly allowed to be larger than unity, we can write it down as:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\sigma_{int}(p_{T\,min})}{\sigma_{tot}}=\langle n \rangle (p_{T\,min})\quad .
\end{equation}
Furthermore, we have to consider the \textit{screening effect}: in fact the incoming hadrons are color singlet objects. Therefore, when the $p_T$ of an exchanged gluon is small, and so the associated wavelength large, this gluon cannot longer resolve the color charges and the effective coupling is decreased, this screening set a cutoff in the divergence. The screening effect is schematically shown in \figRef{fig:ScreeningEffect}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{{img/ScreeningEffect.png}}
	\caption{A picture of the screening effect. The left figure show two color charge that are not resolved by the gluon in fact the wave length is greater than the spatial separation, $d$, of the two charges. So resolution of the probe is not enough to discriminate the color charges. While on the right figure the two charges are very well distinct.}
	\label{fig:ScreeningEffect}
\end{figure}

\noindent So, this cutoff is associated with color screening distance i.e. the average size of the region within the  compensation of color charge occurs.
This cutoff is then introduced in the factor as:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\alpha_s^2\,(p_{T0}^2+p_{T}^2)}{\alpha_s^2\,(p_T^2)}\,\frac{p_T^4}{(p_{T0}^2+p_T^2)^2}\quad .
\end{equation}
This factor contains the phenomenological regularization of the divergence, with the factor $p_{T0}$ that have to be tuned to data. 
\\
Now the interaction cross section is smoothly regularized and therefore finite.
\\
To be notice that: parameter $p_{T0}$ do not have to be energy-independent, but since the energy is related with the sensibility of our probe, higher energy is related with the capacity of probing PDFs to lower x values (as discussed previously, see \figRef{fig:NNPDF31}) and in this low x region the number of partons rapidly increases. So, the partons are closer packed in this regions and as a consequence the color screening distance decrease.
\\
The number of partons is related to $x$ with a power low so, it is likely to have a dependence of the same form for $p_{T0}$ respect to the center-of-mass energy
\begin{equation}
	p_{T0}(\sqrt{s})=p_{T0}^{ref} \,\left( \frac{\sqrt{s}}{E_{CM}^{ref}} \right)^{E_{CM}^{pow}}\quad .
\end{equation}
%In the next section we are going to discuss how this and other effects fit into the Monte Carlo generator \textsc{pythia8}.	
These two parameters are named \texttt{MultiplepartonInteractions:}\-\texttt{pT0Ref} and \texttt{Mul}\-\texttt{tiple}\-\texttt{partonInteractions:}\-\texttt{ecmPow} and control respectively the threshold for the MPI to occur at a fixed center-of-mass energy and the power evolution with $\sqrt{s}$. 


In \textsc{pythia}8 MPI, as said before, are also generated in a decreasing $p_T$ sequence. So the hardest MPI is generated first. Than we can write the probability for an interaction, $i$, to occur at a scale $p_T$ using a Sudakov-type expression (as we have done for the ISR and the FSR):
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\mathcal{P}_{MPI}}{dp_T}=\frac{1}{\sigma_{ND}}\frac{d\sigma_{2\,\rightarrow\,2}}{dp_T}\ \exp\left( -\displaystyle\int_{p_T}^{p_T\,i-1} \frac{1}{\sigma_{ND}}\frac{d\sigma_{2\,\rightarrow\,2}}{dp_T'}\,dp_T' \right)\quad .
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Interleaving of Multiple Interaction and Parton Shower}

As discussed above the ISR, FSR and MPI are simulated in \textsc{Pythia} following a common decreasing $p_T$ evolution.
So we have that the total probability is given from the composition of the various contributions from each process:
\begin{align}
	\frac{d\mathcal{P}}{dp_T}=&\left( \frac{d\mathcal{P}_{MPI}}{dp_T}+\displaystyle\sum\frac{d\mathcal{P}_{ISR}}{dp_T}+\displaystyle\sum\frac{d\mathcal{P}_{FSR}}{dp_T} \right) \nonumber \times\\ 
	&\times\exp\left\{ -\displaystyle\int_{p_T}^{p_T\,i-1} \left( \frac{d\mathcal{P}_{MPI}}{dp_T'}+\displaystyle\sum\frac{d\mathcal{P}_{ISR}}{dp_T'}+\displaystyle\sum\frac{d\mathcal{P}_{FSR}}{dp_T'} \right)\,dp_T' \right\}
	\label{eq:common_pT_sequence}
\end{align}
%
\begin{figure}[!ht]

	\includegraphics[width=12cm]{{img/PartonShower.png}}
	\caption{An example of Multiple Partons Interactions and associated radiations. The downward evolution in $p_T$ is shown here by reading the graph from top to bottom. The 4 parton-parton interactions occur to $p_{T1}$, $p_{T2}$, $p_{T3}$ and $p_{T4}$.}
	\label{fig:PartonShower}
\end{figure}
%
\\
In \figRef{fig:PartonShower} are shown 4 parton-parton interactions with their associated showers (ISR and FSR). The downward evolution correspond to read the graph from top to bottom. The first hard interaction occurs at a scale $p_T=p_{T1}$ while the following ones at lower scales $p_{T2}$, $p_{T3}$, $p_{T4}$. Each interaction is associated with is radiation the first one occurs at $p_T=p_{T1}'$.
The scatterings at $p_{T2}$ and $p_{T3}$ are originating from the same mother parton. 
\\
This diagram is related to one of the two hadrons. The full event can be illustrated if a similar diagram is drawn for the other hadron and connected to the full black circles.

\subsection{Momentum and flavour conservation}

One problem in MPI simulation is to achieve momentum conservation, so we need to take into account the modification in the PDF by the $i-1$ interaction. To do that in \textsc{Pythia} the PDF are rescaled to the remaining available $x$ range, adjusting their normalization.
\\
We need to take into account the momentum fraction $x_i$ removed from the hadron remnant by the $i-th$ interaction. This is done evaluating PDF not at $x_i$ but at a rescaled value
\begin{equation}
	x_i'=\frac{x_i}{X} \qquad \ \text{with }\ \ X=1-\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}x_j\quad .
\end{equation}
So, using these quantities, we can rewrite our PDFs as:
\begin{equation}
	f_i(x,Q^2)\ \longrightarrow\ \frac{1}{X}f_0\left(\frac{x}{X}\right)\quad ,
\end{equation}
where $f_0$ is the original one-parton inclusive PDFs.
\\
Now, requiring also the flavour conservation and taking into account the number of valence and/or sea quarks involved in the preceding MPI. We have now the full forms of the PDFs used for the $i-th$ MPI:
\begin{align}
f_i(x,Q^2) =&  \frac{N_{fv}}{N_{fv0}}\frac{1}{X} f_{v0}\left( \frac{x}{X},Q^2 \right) + \frac{a}{X}f_{s0}\left( \frac{x}{X},Q^2 \right)+\displaystyle\sum_j \frac{1}{X} f_{c_j0}\left( \frac{x}{X},Q^2 \right) \quad,\\
g_i(x,Q^2) =& \frac{a}{X}g_0\left( \frac{x}{X},Q^2 \right)\quad, 
\end{align}
where: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $f_i(x,Q^2)$ $(g_i(x,Q^2))$ are the squeezed PDFs for quarks (gluons);
	\item $N_{fv}$ the number of remaining valence quarks of the given flavour;
	\item $N_{fv0}$ the number of original valence quarks of the given flavour (for the proton we have $N_u=2$, $N_d=1$);
	\item $f_{s0}$ the sea-quark PDF;
	\item $f_{cj}$ the companion PDF, this arise from the splitting $g\,\rightarrow\,q\overline{q}$ and a quark $j$ is kicked out.
\end{itemize}
The factor $a$ is defined to satisfy the total momentum sum rule.

\subsection{Impact Parameter Dependence}

The simplest hypothesis for the multiple interaction simulation, it is to assume the same initial state for all hadron collisions without dependencies on the impact parameter. 
\\
The more realistic scenario it is to include the possibility that each collision could be characterized by a different impact parameter $b$, where a small $b$ value correspond to a large overlap between the two hadrons this is related to the probability of parton-parton interaction to take place.
\\
To include the impact parameter dependence on the collision, it is necessary to make some assumption on the matter distribution inside the proton. A possibility is to assume a spherically symmetric distribution inside an hadron at rest $\rho(\mathbf{x})\,d^3x=\rho(r)\,d^3x$. A Gaussian ansatz is the most simple choice but it appears to lead to a narrow multiplicity distribution and a too little pedestal effect. So the coiche is a double Gaussian:
\begin{equation}
	\rho(r) \propto \frac{1-\beta}{a_1^3}\exp\left\{-\frac{r^2}{a_1^2}\right\}+\frac{\beta}{a_2^3}\exp\left\{ -\frac{r^2}{a_2^2} \right\}\quad,
	\label{eq:matterDistribution}
\end{equation}
where a fraction $\beta$ of matter is contained in a radius $a_2$, and the rest in a larger radius $a_1$. in \textsc{pythia8} these two parameters are named respectively as \texttt{Multiparton}\-\texttt{Interactions:}\-\texttt{core}\-\texttt{Fraction} and \texttt{Multiparton}\-\texttt{Interactions:}\-\texttt{core}\-\texttt{Radius}.

\medskip

Now, for a given matter distribution $\rho(r)$,  the time-integrated overlap function of the incoming hadrons during the collision is given by:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{O}(b)=\displaystyle\int dt \displaystyle\int d^3x\,\rho(x,y,z)\,\rho(x+b,y,z+t)\quad.
	\label{eq:overlappingFunction}
\end{equation} 
Assuming the matter distribution function in \eqRef{eq:matterDistribution} and inserting it into \eqRef{eq:overlappingFunction} we get  the following expression.
\begin{equation}
\small{
	\mathcal{O}(b)\propto \frac{(1-\beta)^2}{2a_1^2}\exp\left\{-\frac{b^2}{2a_1^2}\right\}+\frac{2\beta(1-\beta)}{a_1^2+a_2^2}\exp\left\{ -\frac{b^2}{a_1^2+a_2^2} \right\}+\frac{\beta^2}{2a_2^2}\exp\left\{-\frac{b^2}{2a_2^2}\right\}
	}
\end{equation}
this is useful to quantify the effect of overlapping protons.
The larger is $\mathcal{O}(b)$ the more probable are parton-parton scatters between the incoming protons $\langle \widetilde{n} \rangle\propto \mathcal{O}(b)$.

\medskip

So, these assumption change the so-far Poissonian nature of the framework\footnote{the Poissonian distribution, in \eqRef{eq:poisson} describe the probability of having $n$ interactions at each impact parameter. If the matter distribution have an infinite tail (like our in \eqRef{eq:matterDistribution}) events may be obtained with arbitrarily large b values. This can be a problem for the definition of the total hadron-hadron cross section}
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(\widetilde{n})=
	\left\langle \widetilde{n}\right\rangle ^{\widetilde{n}}\ \frac{e^{-\langle\widetilde{n}\rangle}}{\widetilde{n}!}
	\label{eq:poisson}
\end{equation}
Now the request that at least one parton interactions in the hadron-hadron collision, ensures that we get a finite total cross section. So the probability that an event is produced by two hadrons scattering with impact parameter $b$:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{P}_{\text{int}}= \displaystyle\sum_{\widetilde{n}=1}^\infty\mathcal{P}_{\widetilde{n}(b)}=1-\mathcal{P}_0=1-e^{-\langle \widetilde{n}(b) \rangle}=1-e^{-k\mathcal{O}(b)}
\end{equation}
So we have now that the number of interaction per event is give by (for impact parameter $b$):
\begin{equation}
	\langle n(b) \rangle=\frac{\langle \widetilde{n}(b) \rangle}{\mathcal{P}_{\text{int}}}
\end{equation}
so, this have modified the probability distribution of interactions number from a Poissonian to a narrower one at each $b$ fixed.

%It is not necessary that the partons undergoing to a MPI are a different partons couple from the one scattered before. As shown in \figRef{fig:Rescattering} MPI can also arise when a parton scatters more than once against partons from the other beam, this is call \textit{parton rescattering}.

%We can have 3 type of MPI:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item No ones of the partons that enter in the second scattering undergoes to another scatter before (\figRef{fig:Rescattering} left);
%	\item Only one of the two partons has alredy been scattered (\figRef{fig:Rescattering} middle);
%	\item Both the partons have alredy been scattered before (\figRef{fig:Rescattering} right). 
%\end{enumerate}
%The second and the third are the rescatters the overall influence of rescatters in proton-proton interactions was estimated to be small respect to the first case with distinct $2\,\rightarrow\,2$  scatters. 
%
%The simulation of parton rescatters start from the evaluation of the parton density as:
%\begin{equation}
%	f(x,Q^2)\ \  \longrightarrow\! \underbrace{\phantom{\Bigg(} f_{\text{rescaled}}(x,Q^2)}_{\text{hadron remnant}}+\underbrace{\displaystyle\sum_n \,\delta(x-x_n)}_{\text{scattered parton(s)}}\quad,
%\end{equation} 
%where the $\delta(x-x_i)$ takes into account the already scattered partons that have a fixed momentum fraction $x_n$. While the hadron remnant is still described by a continuous momentum density, scaled to achieve momentum conservation:
%\begin{equation}	\displaystyle\int_0^1 \bigg( f_{\text{rescaled}}(x,Q^2) +\displaystyle\sum_n \,\delta(x-x_n) \bigg)dx=1\quad.
%\end{equation}



\subsection{Beam Beam Remnants and primordial $k_T$}
\label{sec:Beam Beam Remnants and primordial kT}

What is left after that the evolution is end?
\\
The evolution in $p_T$ can create an arbitrary complicate final state. 
This final state contains contributions from the scattered and unscattered partons that don't enter the $p_T$ evolution. The last are the so called \textit{Beam Beam Remnants} (BBR). 
BBR take into account the number of valence quarks remaining and the number of sea quarks required for the overall flavour conservation.
\\
To ensure momentum conservation the BBR have to take all the remaining longitudinal momentum that is not extracted by the MPI initiators.

\subsubsection*{Primordial $k_T$}

We have considered only the longitudinal momentum. In a real scenario partons, inside the hadrons, are fermions. So, are expected to have a non zero initial transverse momentum arising from the Fermi motion inside the incoming hadrons. This is denoted as \textit{primordial $k_T$}. This is different from the transverse momentum derived from DGLAP shower evolution or from the hard interaction.

\bigskip

\noindent Based on Fermi motion alone, one would expect a value of the primordial $k_T$ of the order of: 
\begin{equation}
	k_T\simeq\frac{\hbar}{r_p}\approx\frac{0.2\ \mathrm{GeV\cdot fm}}{0.7\ \mathrm{fm}}\approx0.3\ \mathrm{GeV}\quad,
\label{eq:PrimordialKT}
\end{equation}
but, as an example, to reproduce the data for the $p_T$ distributions of $Z$ bosons produced in hadron–hadron collisions, one need a larger contribution. This phenomenon has not a satisfactory phenomenological explanation. Until a convincing explanation is found the idea is to consider an effective primordial $k_T$ for the initiators larger than the one in \eqRef{eq:PrimordialKT}.

\medskip

In \textsc{pythia} the primordial kT is assigned to initiators sampling a Gaussian distributions for $p_x$ and $p_y$ independently with variable width $\sigma$
\begin{equation}
	\sigma(Q,\widehat{m})=\frac{Q_{1/2}\,\sigma_{\text{soft}}+Q\,\sigma_{\text{soft}}}{Q_{1/2}+Q}\,\frac{\widehat{m}}{\widehat{m}_{1/2}+\widehat{m}}
\end{equation}
Where $Q$ is the hard-process renormalization scale for the main hard process and the $p_T$ scale for subsequent MPI. $\sigma_{\text{soft}}$, $\sigma_{\text{hard}}$ are the minimum and maximum width, $\widehat{m}$ is the invariant mass, while $Q_{1/2}$ and $\widehat{m}_{1/2}$ the halfway values between the two extremes.

In \textsc{pythia} the maximum width parameters is called \texttt{Beam}\-\texttt{Remnants:}\-\texttt{primordialKT}\-\texttt{hard}.

\subsection{Color Reconnection}

The last important step at parton level is the \textit{color reconnection}. Color reconnection is motivated by the fact that MPI leads to different color strings. In the previous steps the planar limit of the QCD was assumed where $N_c\rightarrow\infty$. Now, moving to real case where $N_c=3$ all this strings that can be overlapped in physical space can be reconnected. The basic idea is to reconnect strings in order to reduce the total string length; and thus the potential energy (Lund Model).
\\
In \textsc{pythia8} the reconnection is performed giving to each system a probability to reconnect given by:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{P}_{\text{rec}}=\frac{p_{T\,\text{rec}}^2}{\left(p_{T\,\text{rec}}^2 + p_T^2\right)} \qquad\quad p_{T\,\text{rec}}=R\times p_{T\,0}\quad,
\end{equation} 
the \texttt{ColorReconnection:range} $R$ is a user-tunable parameter while $p_{T\,0}$ is the same parameter defined in MPI simulation.
\\
With this definition for the probability, it is clear that system with low $p_T$ are more likely reconnected to other. This idea find is justification in the fact that lower $p_T$ values correspond to larger spatial extension and so these strings have more chance to overlap with other and so to reconnect.

%\subsubsection*{Hadronization}
%
%The hadronization takes all these partons (color strings) and transforms them in a set of color-neutral hadrons. Hadronization is based solely on the \textit{Lund string fragmentation model} \cite{ANDERSSON198331, Sjostrand:1984ic}. 
%\\
%Lund model basic idea is to break the color line and to reduce the total string length, the string is representative of the potential
%\begin{equation}
%	V(r)=-\frac{a}{r}+\kappa r \qquad\qquad \text{with}\quad \kappa\approx1\ \mathrm{GeV/fm}\quad,
%\end{equation}
%where $\kappa$ is the string tension.  This potential is a combination of an attractive (Coulomb) potential ad a linear potential that phenomenologically include quarks confinement. The linear potential is the dominating part at increasing distance values, so the energy increase with distance. 
%\\
%The simplest case is the one in \figRef{fig:StringBreakings}: The $q\overline{q}$ system evolves in space increasing the string length at some point the distance is to large and is convenient to break the string into two strings.
%
%\begin{figure}[!ht]
%	\centering
%	\includegraphics[width=12cm]{{img/StringBreakings.png}}
%	\caption{The lund Model is schematically shown here. The string evolution in time is shown vertically while the spatial position horizontally. As the partons move apart at some point become convenient to break the string, in order to reduce the total potential energy, and a partons pair is produced.}
%	\label{fig:StringBreakings}
%\end{figure}

%So the hadronization try to reduce the string length.
%\begin{equation}
%	V(r)=-\frac{a}{r}+\kappa r \qquad\qquad \text{with}\quad \kappa\approx1\ \mathrm{GeV/fm}
%\end{equation}
%The hadronization step confines the quark into hadrons, then these hadrons can undergoes to hadron rescattering and decay. These are the hadrons that are revealed by the detectors.

\section{\textsc{pythia} summary}

To summarize \textsc{pythia8} is able to simulate high energy hadron-hadron collisions. The evolution of the system is simulated in a common decreasing-$p_T$ sequence the master formula for the evolution is written in \eqRef{eq:common_pT_sequence}. 
\\
This evolution start from an hard scale that is the scale of the main parton hard scattering that is described by a fixed ME calculation, \textsc{pythia} can be interfaced with external frameworks for the ME step as \textsc{powheg} and \textsc{mad-graph5 amc@nlo} (some care have to be taken as described in \secRef{sec:merging}). Then the parton shower is started with the simulation of ISR, FSR and MPI also the parton rescattering is allowed. Once the evolution is ended the color reconnection and the hadronization transform the partons in a set of final hadrons these hadron than decay and rescatters against each others before the detection.
\\
A schematic view of these processes is shown in \figRef{fig:Processes}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.98\textwidth]{{img/Processes.png}}
	\caption{A schematic representation for a $pp$ collision. Reading the image from left to right one can have an idea on the evolution of the system. The two incoming hadrons enter the scattering from the left side, the red line indicate the main hard scattering and the magenta one the second parton scattering (MPI) each interaction is associated with initial (blue) and final (green) state radiation, the unscattered partons (black lines) re-enter the color reconnection and hadronization processes. Than the new formed hadrons (lightblue) can undergo to different decays.}
	\label{fig:Processes}
\end{figure}


\noindent All these processes are describe mainly by phenomenological model, due to the not-known-by-first-principles soft QCD description. The use of these phenomenological models introduces lots of free parameters (some are been pointed out in this sections) that have to be tuned with data to give to \textsc{pythia} the ability of simulates real events.

Next chapter will focus on the study of the underlying event and so on all the soft events related to an hard scattering in an hadron-hadron collision with the description of the analyses used in our tune and the effects of some of these \textsc{pythia}8 parameters on these observables distributions.
