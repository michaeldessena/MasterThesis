\chapter{Observable to Study the Underlying Event}

The UE are all the processes not associated with the primary hard scatter in an hadron-hadron collision.

All the process described in the previous section: initial- and final-state radiation, multiple interactions, and beam
remnants and their interactions. These contribute to the Underlying Event (UE) in the proton-proton collision.

The most of the observable to study the UE are sensible only to the sum of these contributions and not to the single ones.

\section{Minimum Bias Measurements and Underlying Event topology}

A Minimum Bias (MB) measurement is a collection of inelastic events with a loose event selection. The event are collected requiring the minimal interaction with the detector (the smallest possible bias). The most of the interaction in MB observation are soft, $p_T\lesssim2\ \mathrm{GeV}$. The study of the UE require at least one hard scattering presence.
